My research involves performing molecular dynamics simulations on proteins. There are a number of ways in which machine learning could be used. One would be the classification of binding modes of a 2 protein simulation. Molecular dynamics generates a lot of data; of most interest in protein binding would probably be the distances between amino acids, or their constituent atoms, between proteins. One can perform PCA on this data and attempt to cluser binding modes. This is most likely a problem for unsupervised learning as we probably do not know what we are looking for beforehand. This is perhaps a good way to look at the data but validating the meaning of the clusters is probably difficult. If the analysis identifies interactions of importance we didn't know of beforehand, it's possible expermental methods like FRET or mutating specific residues could provide some validation.
